OPTIMIZING YOUR BANANA RIPENING ROOM FOR ETHYLENE APPLICATION

greenhouse tomato ripening ethanol ethylene

evaporate ethanol to ethylene

bio ethanol the stuff they put in burners

do not like next ethylene generators

because they do not give any information via an LCD display in case something is wrong

can be so much better = reservoir, valve , heating reservoir element for evaporation, temperature sensors, error status light

let arduino handle temperature, valve, time, duration, etc. and messages

add a arduino (wifi) ethylene ppm sensor for turning generator on/off

the seller / supermarket should let you know if the product is artificial ripened

#            !!! DANGER !!!
# GENERATOR CREATES ETHYLENE (C2H4).
# ETHYLENE IS EXPLOSIVE AT 27,000 PPM.
